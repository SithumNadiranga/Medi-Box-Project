# SMART MEDI BOX
* Utilized an ESP32 microcontroller to develop a smart medi-box capable of triggering alarms for medication
  reminders and displaying the current date and time.
* Enhanced the medi-box with online monitoring features through a Node-Red dashboard and Mosquitto broker.
* Implemented light intensity and temperature monitoring near the medi-box, controlling a stepper motor-driven
  window to provide shade when necessary.
